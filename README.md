This is a what I like to think CodePen would have looked like had it been a mobile application.<br>
Since there's not an official CodePen API the app is not fully functional and displays only a couple of basic features. I leveraged the awesome work done by [Nate Wiley](https://github.com/natewiley) on the [CodePen unoffical API](https://github.com/natewiley/cpv2api/).<br>


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.1.
