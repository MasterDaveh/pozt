This is a what I like to think CodePen would have looked like had it been a mobile application.<br>
Since there's not an official CodePen API the app is not fully functional and displays only a couple of basic features. I leveraged the awesome work done by [Nate Wiley](https://github.com/natewiley) on the [CodePen unoffical API](https://github.com/natewiley/cpv2api/).<br>

## Usage
1) Install the Angular CLI
```javascript
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
2) Install all the project dependancies
```javascript
npm install
```
3) Spin up a local server to preview the app
```javascript
ng serve -o
```
 You are good to go!
